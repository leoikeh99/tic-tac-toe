## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
- **Added**: Users can create online challenges and play against friends.

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/) - JS runtime environment
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Socket IO](https://scoket.io) - JS Web socket library

### What I learned

For this project I am very happy I got to use Web sockets (Socket IO), this is a technology that I have found very interesting for a while now and when I saw this tic tac toe challenge I decided to add an online game feature so as to learn more and put in practice using Web sockets.

### Continued development

Of course I will definitely keep leaning Web sockets in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax-Engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tic-tac-toe-minimax-engine) - This really helped me in the CPU section of the game, i used this engine to generate the best computer moves.
- [Socket IO](https://scoket.io) - They're site just contains a good documentation of Socket IO
- [Socket IO functions summary](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/whatever/emit+to+all+sockets+socket.io) - Contains a list of Socket IO functions and they're meanings (was very useful for me).
